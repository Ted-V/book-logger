# Book-logger
A basic app that let's you track your reading history. It's intended to be used as a playground for practicing UI testing skills. My plan is to update it occasionally to learn and implement new front-end concepts. Also, whenever I add a new feature, I plan to write automated test scripts to test that feature.

This app is featured in a tutorial I wrote on Selenium WebDriver. As stated, it is unpolished and meant to be used for learning purposes. You can find the tutorial [here](https://github.com/Ted-V/portfolio/blob/main/resources/Selenium_JS_Tutorial/seleniumtut.md).
