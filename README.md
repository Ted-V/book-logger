# Book-logger
A simple app that let's you track your reading history. It's intended to be used as a playground for practicing UI testing skills. 

This app is featured in a tutorial I wrote on Selenium WebDriver. As stated, it is unpolished and meant to be used for learning purposes. You can find the tutorial [here](https://github.com/Ted-V/portfolio/blob/main/resources/Selenium_JS_Tutorial/seleniumtut.md)
